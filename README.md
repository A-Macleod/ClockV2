This repository is part of the module **UG409765 - Software Construction** and serves as the foundation for the multi-alarm clock application.

## **Overview**
This repository contains an analogue clock implemented using the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** architecture. Students will extend this application to include multi-alarm
